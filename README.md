This repository includes a visualization of the data collected for the "Bellybutton Biodiversity" study performed by the NC Public Science Lab.

The Module_14_Challenge file includes the HTML framework for the visualization under the "index.html" file, as well as its corresponding "application.js" file which adds the visualization functionality to the site. 

Unfortunately, I was not able to correctly deploy the site to Github Pages. However, everything does render correctly according to the assignment instructions.
